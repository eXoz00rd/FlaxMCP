MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for **[Flax Engine](https://flaxengine.com)** projects, built with **.NET 10 / C#**
on the official [ModelContextProtocol C# SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ModelContextProtocol).

> **Status:** source-only alpha. The server and bridge work from a checkout, but no public package or MCP registry entry
> has been released yet.

## Why

Flax projects combine JSON project and scene files, binary content assets, a native build pipeline, and state that exists
only inside the running editor. FlaxMCP gives an MCP client one interface to all of them:

- offline project, content, and scene inspection;
- headless script compilation, game builds, and structured log diagnostics;
- a local editor plugin for live scenes, selection, transforms, saving, play mode, and viewport screenshots.

C# navigation and refactoring remain the job of an IDE-integrated MCP such as Rider. FlaxMCP focuses on engine operations
and editor state that a conventional code model cannot see.

## Tools

The default configuration exposes 27 tools across seven toolsets. `server` is always enabled; every other toolset can be
selected with `FLAX_TOOLSETS`.

| Toolset | Tools |
|---|---|
| `server` | `server_info`, `flax_status` |
| `project` | `project_info`, `project_targets`, `project_settings` |
| `content` | `content_search`, `content_asset_info`, `content_resolve_guid` |
| `scene` | `scene_list`, `scene_outline`, `scene_find_actor` |
| `build` | `build_generate_projects`, `build_compile_scripts`, `build_clear_cache`, `build_game`, `build_status`, `build_result` |
| `logs` | `logs_tail`, `logs_errors` |
| `editor` | `editor_scene_graph`, `editor_get_selection`, `editor_set_selection`, `editor_actor_details`, `editor_modify_actor`, `editor_save`, `editor_play_mode`, `editor_screenshot` |

`editor_execute_csharp` is an additional editor tool that is absent by default. It appears only when
`FLAX_ALLOW_CODE_EXECUTION=true` and read-only mode is disabled.

### Offline inspection

`project_info` reads the `.flaxproj`; `project_targets` parses declarations from `*.Build.cs`; and `project_settings`
returns structured settings assets. The content tools maintain an in-memory index under `Content/`, including GUID and
type metadata read from Flax 1.12 binary asset headers. Unrecognized binary assets remain searchable by path without
guessed metadata.

The scene tools parse `.scene` and `.prefab` files without starting the editor. Actor trees use `ParentID` relationships,
attach scripts to their owners, and report when response limits truncate a result.

### Builds and logs

`build_generate_projects`, `build_compile_scripts`, and `build_clear_cache` run the editor headlessly and wait for the
operation. Script compilation extracts structured diagnostics rather than returning a raw log.

`build_game` can take minutes, so it starts a background job and immediately returns a job ID:

1. Call `build_game` with a preset and target, for example `Development` and `Windows`.
2. Poll `build_status` with the returned job ID.
3. Call `build_result` after the status is no longer `running`.

Build tools refuse to start a second editor process while the same project has a live editor session. Close the GUI editor
before using them. `logs_tail` and `logs_errors` only read the newest project log and remain available while it is running.

The `diagnose_build_failure` prompt combines `build_compile_scripts` with `logs_errors` to distinguish compiler failures
from engine or project-configuration errors.

### Live editor bridge

The `editor` tools communicate with the companion plugin over a local named pipe. `flax_status` reports whether the
configured project has a reachable, protocol-compatible session. Live calls fail clearly when the editor or plugin is not
running; the server reconnects after a script reload or a new editor session without restarting.

Live scene reads include unsaved state. Write tools change selection and transforms, save modified scenes and assets, and
control play mode with `start`, `pause`, `resume`, or `stop`. `editor_screenshot` writes a PNG of the visible scene viewport;
it requires a GUI editor with a rendered viewport and does not work headlessly. Its destination directory must exist.

## Requirements

- .NET 10 SDK
- Flax Engine 1.12.6912 or newer installed locally
- a Flax project (`.flaxproj`)
- the companion plugin installed in that project for live editor tools

## Setup from source

### 1. Get and validate the server

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eXoz00rd/FlaxMCP.git
cd FlaxMCP
dotnet build FlaxMcp.slnx
dotnet test FlaxMcp.slnx
dotnet format --verify-no-changes
```

### 2. Install the editor bridge

Add the bridge project to the consumer project's `References` array, using an absolute path or one relative to the
consumer `.flaxproj`:

```json
{
  "References": [
    { "Name": "$(EnginePath)/Flax.flaxproj" },
    { "Name": "../FlaxMCP/src/FlaxMcpBridge/FlaxMcpBridge.flaxproj" }
  ]
}
```

Keep existing references and adjust only the bridge path. Flax discovers the `EditorPlugin` from this reference; no
consumer-side `PrivateDependencies` or `Modules.Add` entry is required. Start or reload the GUI editor and call
`flax_status` to confirm `connected: true`.

### 3. Configure an MCP client

Use the checkout as the process target. This JSON shape works for clients that accept an `mcpServers` map, including
Claude Code configuration files:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flax": {
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": ["run", "--project", "D:/Tools/FlaxMCP/src/FlaxMcp"],
      "env": {
        "FLAX_PROJECT_PATH": "D:/Projects/YourFlaxProject"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

In Rider's MCP server settings, create a stdio server with the same command, arguments, checkout, and environment
variables. Prefer absolute paths because GUI clients do not necessarily inherit the shell working directory.

Call `server_info`, `project_info`, and `flax_status` as a basic verification.

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FLAX_PROJECT_PATH` | yes | Path to a `.flaxproj`, or a directory containing exactly one top-level `.flaxproj` |
| `FLAX_ENGINE_PATH` | no | Flax Engine root. When omitted, uses the Flax Launcher's `%APPDATA%/Flax/Versions.txt` registrations |
| `FLAX_EDITOR_CONFIG` | no | Editor binary configuration: `Development` (default), `Debug`, or `Release` |
| `FLAX_TOOLSETS` | no | Comma-separated selection from `project`, `content`, `scene`, `build`, `logs`, and `editor`; `server` is always included. Omit for all toolsets |
| `FLAX_READ_ONLY` | no | `true`, `1`, or `yes` removes all tools that can alter files or editor state |
| `FLAX_BRIDGE` | no | Bridge mode placeholder; defaults to `auto`. It is parsed but does not currently change connection behavior |
| `FLAX_ALLOW_CODE_EXECUTION` | no | Enables `editor_execute_csharp` only when true and `FLAX_READ_ONLY` is false |
| `FLAX_LOG_LEVEL` | no | Minimum server log level written to stderr; defaults to `Warning` |

Unknown toolset names fail at startup and list valid values. With `FLAX_READ_ONLY=true`, the remaining tools are
`server_info`, `flax_status`, all project/content/scene tools, `build_status`, `build_result`, both log tools,
`editor_scene_graph`, `editor_get_selection`, and `editor_actor_details`.

## Security

- The bridge accepts local named-pipe connections and records discovery data under `%APPDATA%/FlaxMcp/sessions`; it does
  not require network credentials.
- Build and editor write tools run with the current user's filesystem and process permissions. Use
  `FLAX_READ_ONLY=true` for inspection-only clients.
- `editor_execute_csharp` compiles and runs arbitrary C# on the editor main thread with the Flax Editor process's full
  machine permissions, including access to files, processes, credentials, and the network. Enable it only for trusted
  clients and prompts.

## Troubleshooting

### `flax_status` reports `connected: false`

Confirm the configured project matches the project open in Flax, the bridge reference is present in its `.flaxproj`, and
the editor has finished compiling scripts. Reload scripts or restart the editor after adding the plugin. Check the latest
project log for `[FlaxMcpBridge] Pipe server started` or a plugin compilation error.

### Protocol mismatch

The server and editor plugin came from incompatible revisions. Update both from the same checkout, let Flax recompile the
plugin, and reload scripts. A mismatch is rejected explicitly rather than sent through an incompatible protocol.

### A build says the editor is already running

Headless build operations intentionally refuse to race a GUI editor using the same project and `Cache/` directory. Close
that editor session normally, then retry. Log-reading and live-editor tools do not require this step.

### Screenshot capture fails

Open a scene in the GUI editor and ensure its scene viewport is visible. Capture requires a rendered viewport, cannot run
headlessly, only accepts a `.png` path, and does not create the destination directory.

## Roadmap

The source alpha covers offline inspection, build/log tooling, and the live editor bridge. Remaining release work includes
clean installation testing, NuGet publication, MCP registry metadata, and final documentation validation. See the
[project board](https://github.com/users/eXoz00rd/projects/3) for current status.
